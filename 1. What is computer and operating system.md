## 1.1 What is a computer and operating system?

- Operating system gives programs access to the metal.
- Offers services to the system user (person, computer…)
- Controls memory and I/O
- Is an interface.

1. [[CPU]]
2. Memory
3. I/O Modules

Connected by bus (Системная шина)

## 1.1.1 Processor

Controls operations, handles data, contains internal memory (registers)

2 main parts:
- ALU - arithmetic logic
- CU - control unit

## 1.1.2 Memory

Inconsistent: data is lost when turned off
Array of cells with addresses: instructions, data

## 1.1.3 I/O Modules

Transportation of data between the computer and external devices.

## 1.1.4 Bus

1. Control bus
2. Address bus
3. Data bus

## 1.1.5 [[Registers]]

Way smaller and faster than memory.
Some registers are accessible to users.
Some of them are used for controlling and statuses.

## 1.1.6 Register of flags

Stores status of execution of an operation. (yes/no)
Readonly

## 1.1.7 Programs and instructions

Program is array of instructions.
Processor reads instructions into register of instructions and executes them.
Clock contains address of the command (current or next)

### Instruction cycle
1. Start
2. Fetch next instruction
3. Execute instruction
4. HALT/Fetch 

## 1.1.8 Interruptions

Interruption of row of instructions.

- For improving usage of the central processor.
- I/O devices are slow, CP is fast.
- Pauses are bad.
- Multitasking.

If processor waits for printer, it will do nothing, so it does not wait. 

>Processor - heart that should not stop.

### Multiinterruption
What happens if an interruption happens while another interruption is being handled?

#### We can do two things:
1. Not allow interruptions while other interruption is handled
2. Use prioroties

## 1.1.9 Multiprogramming

Processor must execute several programs
Order depends on priority and I/O interactions

## 1.1.10 External memory

Data is stored without being plugged in.
For storing programs and data.
