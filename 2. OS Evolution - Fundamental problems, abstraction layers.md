Operating system is interpreter that talks to the metal.

### 3 layers of abstractions:
1. Apps
2. OS
3. Metal

## 2.1 OS Evolution

- Serial Processing
	- No OS
	- Direct use of the computer
	- Problems
		- Planning
		- Time on preparing for working with the pc
- Batch Processing
	- Запуск процессов партиями
	- Multiprogramming
	- ![[multiprogramming.png]]
- Time Sharing Systems
	- Multiprogramming with multiple users
	- Problems
		1. Have to protect memory of one process from another
		2. File systems must also be protected
		3. Access restrictions must be applied

## 2.2 CPU modes

- Kernel mode - gives os access to users, programs
- User mode - gives some access
- Can be more...

## 2.3 Process

Program at execution stage
Instance

Consists of:
1. Context
2. Data
3. Program

## 2.4 Virtual memory

- Independent schemes of addressing memory for processes.
- Memory protection between applications
- Usage of extra memory

## 2.5 Kernel

1. Monolithic kernel
	- Positive: Fast
	- One piece goes down - the whole OS goes down too
1. Microkernel - vice versa of monolithic
2. Others...
